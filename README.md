## About Job+
![Note: There was only one job listed on GitHub jobs in the State of Washington when I took the screenshot....](https://github.com/mastevb/JobRecommendation/blob/master/jobs_img/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-14%20at%204.27.02%20PM.png)
Job+ is a **prototyped** Java-based job search and recommendation web application that aims to improve job search and recommendation. The application recommends job postings based on users' geolocation and a content-based recommendation algorithm.
